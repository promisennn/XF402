# What is XF402?

XF402 is an extension of the **HTTP `402 Payment Required`** mechanism for the Web3 era — enabling **time-based access rights**, **usage licenses**, and **cryptographic receipts** for digital assets.

It builds on Coinbase’s x402 standard and adds:

| Capability                    | Description                                         |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| ⏳ **Time-bounded access**     | Access content for 1h, 1d, 7d, 30d, etc             |
| 🎭 **Usage rights profiles**   | View, remix, commercial-lite, commercial-pro        |
| ✅ **Verifiable receipts**     | JWT signature or on-chain anchor                    |
| 🪙 **Wallet payments**         | Solana USDC first, other chains later               |
| 🤖 **Agent automation**        | Autonomous bots pay on demand to unlock resources   |

## 🧠 Core Insight

Web3 solved **ownership**, but never **usage**.

XF402 introduces a primitive for:

> _“Own forever or pay for temporary access — programmatically.”_

It brings Web2 paywalls and licensing to **wallets + agents**.

Client ->> Server: Request asset
Server ->> Client: 402 Payment Required + tier options
Client ->> Blockchain: Pay USDC (Solana)
Client ->> Server: Submit tx proof
Server ->> Client: Asset + signed receipt
Client ->> Resource: Access as long as receipt valid

### 🔗 Relationship to x402

| Layer                | Role                                 |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------|
| HTTP                 | Transport                            |
| x402                 | Defines machine-payable HTTP         |
| XF402 / R402         | Adds rental tiers, rights, receipts  |
| Solana / L2s         | Settlement and proof layer           |

- ✅ All R402 requests are valid x402 requests  
- ✅ XF402 does not replace wallets, NFTs, or token ownership — it augments them

### 🏗️ Components

| Component                | Purpose                                         |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Client SDK               | Detects 402 → picks tier → pays → retries       |
| Server handler           | Issues 402 + pricing                            |
| Facilitator (optional)   | Verifies payment + signs receipt                |
| Solana program (future)  | On-chain receipt registry / enforcement         |

### 📦 Minimal Request/Response Pattern

**Client → Server**
```
GET /poster.png
```

**Server → Client**
```
402 Payment Required
{
  "profile": "r402/v1",
  "tiers": [
    { "id": "1d", "price": "0.05 USDC" }
  ]
}
```
Client pays → retries → unlocks resource
