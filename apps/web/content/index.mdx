# Introduction

XF402 is an open protocol standard for renting, licensing, and monetizing digital assets — from NFTs and event tickets to memes, AI models, and media — built on top of the x402 payment primitive introduced by Coinbase.

Instead of treating digital ownership as static and permanent, **XF402 introduces time-bound access and usage rights** — powered by automated wallet payments and verifiable receipts.

XF402 extends the HTTP 402 Payment Required flow into Web3, enabling applications, creators, and autonomous agents to enforce:

- **Time-based access** (1h, 1d, 7d, 30d)
- **Usage tiers** (view, remix, commercial, full-license)
- **On-chain receipts & verified access tokens**
- **Wallet-to-wallet streaming micropayments**

With XF402, any digital object becomes rentable, licenseable, and programmatically monetizable — _without transferring ownership_.

## 🌉 Mission & Ecosystem Proposal

XF402 is designed as an open, chain-agnostic protocol —  
but we are actively drafting it as a formal standard for **Solana**.

This includes ecosystem alignment across:

- Solana Foundation standards & research
- Token extensions & compressed assets
- NFT + media frameworks (Metaplex, Helium Foundation)
- Payment networks (xSOL / Solana Pay / Drift agent payments)
- Agent frameworks (Axiom, Backpack agents, dialect bots, Autonomous Worlds)

**🎯 Goal:** _Make Rented Access Rights a first-class primitive on Solana._  
Think **“Token Extensions for Time-Bound Rights.”**

## 🚀 Use Cases You Can Build Today

- **Rentable NFTs** (PFP display rights, art exhibition licensing)
- **Meme licensing** with remix tracking & rev-sharing
- **Ticketing & gated access** for events, communities, & courses
- **AI model access-as-a-service** (LLM endpoints & weights)
- **Pay-per-use APIs & AI agent payments**
- **Media streaming pay-per-minute** (P2P or CDN-hybrid)

## 💡 Why It Matters

For the first time, Web3 can monetize **use** instead of only ownership.

- Creators earn when content is accessed.
- Developers earn when APIs are invoked.
- Agents pay other agents autonomously.
- Communities build sustainable, recurring economies.

The internet evolves from:

> 🛍️ **Buy once** → ⚡ **Access as long as you pay**  
> Ownership becomes dynamic, programmable, shared, and monetizable.

**Rent rights, not tokens.**
